# Algorithm-Analysis
This is a brief analysis of 3 sorting algorithms by their complexity and performance by random inputs 

The whole analysis is in the Analysis.pdf file.

You can run the project easily without doing any edit. It takes random inputs at different sizes and sorts them by three different algorithm
